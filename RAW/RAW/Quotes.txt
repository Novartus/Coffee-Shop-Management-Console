Coffee is a beverage that puts one to sleep when not drank.
I have measured out my life with coffee spoons.
Good communication is just as stimulating as black coffee, and just as hard to sleep after.
Way too much coffee. But if it weren't for the coffee, I'd have no identifiable personality whatsoever.
